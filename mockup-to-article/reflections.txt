Your response goes here!
  * I have learned about doc type declarations and why it is important to use them
  * The majority of it so far has been easy since I have a background knowledge of html and css already
  * Not very difficult so far, but I've been trying this out in new ways and trying to break old bad habits so that's been a bit tricky
  * I have no run into any major problems yet, but for smaller things I have used the developer mozilla html look up website
