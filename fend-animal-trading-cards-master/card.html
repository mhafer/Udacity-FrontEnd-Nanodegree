			<p>
				Their lack of movement acts as a defense mechanism against predators. Sloths
				are slow that algae grows on their fur, serving as a camouflage for them!
				Sloths live entirely in trees, only coming to the ground for bathroom breaks.
				Sloths only take bathroom breaks about once a week! On rare occasions, they've
				been seen moving as fast as cats.
